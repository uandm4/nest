                        1.2 Why you should read them. Please read these terms carefully before you submit your order to us. These terms tell you who we are, how we will provide products to you, how you and we may change or end the contract, what to do if there is a problem and other important information. If you think that there is a mistake in these terms, please contact us to discuss.

                        3.1 How we will accept your order. Our acceptance of your order will take place when we email you to accept it, at which point a contract will come into existence between you and us.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3.2 If we cannot proceed with your order. If we are unable to proceed with your order, we will inform you of this and will offer you a full refund for the product and delivery where applicable or a similar replacement at your discretion. This might be because the product is out of stock, because of unexpected limits on our resources which we could not reasonably plan for, because (if applicable) a credit reference we have obtained for you does not meet our minimum requirements, because we have identified an error in the price or description of the product.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3.3 Your order number. We will assign an order number to your order and tell you what it is when we accept your order. It will help us if you can tell us the order number whenever you contact us about your order. Your order number will start with the prefix WEB.

                        4.1 Products may vary slightly from their pictures. The images of the products on our website are for illustrative purposes only. Although we have made every effort to display the colours accurately, we cannot guarantee that a device’s display of the colours accurately reflects the colour of the products. Your product may vary slightly from those images. Although we have made every effort to be as accurate as possible, because some of our products are handmade, all sizes, weights, capacities, dimensions and measurements indicated on our website may vary slightly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4.2 For all products made from natural materials, such as but not limited to leather, wood or marble, it is not possible to guarantee the goods supplied will have the same colour, shade, pattern and/or finish as shown on the website, due to the inherent nature of such materials and that they are natural materials which do vary from piece to piece. Also, we cannot guarantee to match products exactly which have been ordered at different times.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4.3 For glass products, any imperfection is to be considered as a distinguishing feature of craftsmanship, which makes each piece unique. Glass undergoes a thermal treatment that may cause some very slight imperfections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4.4 For some plastic products bubbles and moulding marks are part of the production process and are not to be deemed defective in any way.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4.5 Product packaging may vary. The packaging of the product may vary from that shown in images on our website. Due to updates in packaging designed by our brands/suppliers, we cannot guarantee that your order will have identical packaging when items are purchased in multiples. We may, in some cases, re-use packaging in order to reduce our waste.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4.6 Making sure your measurements are accurate. You are responsible for ensuring the items you purchase are able to fit into the space you intend them for and can be delivered through any openings and other spaces to their proposed end place, and/or if we make a custom-built item to measurements you are providing, you are responsible for ensuring that these measurements are correct. If you are unsure, we recommend you contact us for guidance before you order but you will still remain responsible for all measurements taken and/or provided.

                    If you wish to make a change to the product you have ordered please contact us. We will let you know if the change is possible. If it is possible we will let you know about any changes to the price of the product, the timing of supply or anything else which would be necessary as a result of your requested change and ask you to confirm whether you wish to go ahead with the change.

                        6.1 Minor changes to the products. We may change the product:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                (a) to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements; and

                    <li>
                        6.2 More significant changes to the products and these terms. In addition, as we informed you in the description of the product on our website or via email communication, we may make the following changes to the product, but if we do so we will notify you before the changes take effect:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                (a) Where the product specification changes significantly.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            In the circumstances above, we will discuss with you the best options available to you and you may contact us to end the contract before changes take effect and receive a refund for any products and delivery paid for but not yet received.
                        </p>

                        7.1 Delivery costs. The costs of delivery will be as displayed to you on our website, which may be subject to change. In the event of any change, you will have the right to terminate the contract with us so long as you inform us within 14 days of receiving our notification of the change in the delivery costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        7.2 When we will provide the products. After you complete the checkout process and pay for your order, we will endeavour to let you know an estimate of when we are likely to provide the products to you within 7-10 working days, but this can be subject to change.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        7.3 We are not responsible for delays outside our control. As we do not manufacture the products we supply, if our supply of the products is delayed by an event outside our control then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the event, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us to end the contract and receive a refund for any products you have paid for but not received. You will be notified of your estimated delivery time but for the avoidance of doubt, these could be between 2-16 weeks or other lead times which may apply at the time of the order. In some cases, shorter lead times can be provided by our brands/suppliers although our website shows a lengthier timeframe, for the avoidance of doubt, if this earlier date is moved back later, this is not a delay providing the lead time is still within the estimated timeframe shown on our website. The lead times shown on our website are for production only and do not include transit/delivery time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        7.4 Collection by you. If you have asked to collect the products from our premises, you can collect them during our warehouse working hours on weekdays between 9 am and 4 pm (excluding public holidays). We will notify you when your products are ready for collection. We cannot help you load the goods due to insurance liability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        7.5 If you are not at home when the product is delivered. If no one is available at your address to take delivery and the products cannot be posted through your letterbox, our delivery partner will notify you of a failed delivery and they will provide you with information on how to rearrange delivery or collect the products from a local depot.

We will contact you to tell you we are suspending the supply of the products. We will not suspend the products where you dispute the unpaid invoice (see clause 15.7). We will not charge you for the products during the period for which they are suspended. As well as suspending the products we can also charge you interest on your overdue payments (see clause 15.6).

If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the goods and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.

                        15.1 Where to find the price for the product. The price of the product (which includes VAT, if applicable) will be the price indicated on the web pages when you placed your order. VAT is automatically removed if you are arranging delivery to a non-VAT-paying country. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the price of the product advised to you is correct. However please see clause 15.3 for what happens if we discover an error in the price of the product you order.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        15.2 We will pass on changes in the rate of VAT (if applicable). If the rate of VAT changes between your order date and the date we supply the product, we will adjust the rate of VAT that you pay, unless you have already paid for the product in full before the change in the rate of VAT takes effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        15.3 What happens if we got the price wrong. It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so that, where the product’s correct price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the product’s correct price at your order date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we proceed with your order. If we accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid and, if applicable, require the return of any goods provided to you.

This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You must pay us interest together with any overdue amount.

                        19.3 Nobody else has any rights under this contract. This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any right to enforce any of its terms.

If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the products, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.
