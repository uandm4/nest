                    <b class="note">Please note</b>
                    Customers are required to provide Atlas with 48hr notice to cancel an existing booking, failure to do so will result in the current delivery charge being payable to Atlas and also an additional charge for the re-arranged delivery. If no one is home to accept the delivery charge at the pre-agreed time, this will be classed as a Failed Delivery and a Failed Delivery Charge will be payable.
                </p>

            <h3>International Deliveries. What are my options?</h3>
            <div>
                <b class="note">Please note</b>
                All our international orders are shipped according to the Incoterms® 2020 standards and typically travel by the Delivered At Place (DAP) term. This means that all international deliveries are curb-side only and the delivery company will require assistance unloading larger items. On-site installation is not currently available for international orders. Please see section 8 of our <a href="gnbF_usefulLink_terms-and-conditions.html">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> for full details.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <b class="txtTitle">Standard delivery</b>
                <li>
                    <b class="txtTitle">Small/medium items</b>
                    Our standard shipping on small items means your items will typically arrive with you within 4-10 days (depending on the final destination), providing your items are in stock and being delivered by our preferred courier partners TNT or Fedex. This is a fully trackable service. All items purchased that are in stock will be sent out to you within one to two working days. All orders placed after 2pm (UK time) for in-stock items will be processed the next working day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b class="txtTitle">Large/fragile/bulky items</b>
                    Our standard shipping for larger orders, fragile or bulky/oversized items (that are unable to be delivered by courier) means your goods will typically arrive 4-6 weeks after they’ve been dispatched from us. For deliveries within the EU, this transit time is shorter, and your good will typically arrive with you 1-2 weeks after they’ve been dispatched from us. This is pending customs clearance and providing there are no unforeseen circumstances.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Bulky, multiple item orders and oversized goods - such as, but not limited to lounge chairs, stools, shelving, chairs, armchairs, large lamps, sofas, sideboards or tables - will need to be transported by a freight forwarder specialist, being palletised and most often travelling via sea freight. The freight costs depend on the value of the goods, their weight/volume and the country of delivery. Preparation of export documentation can sometimes cause delays (approximately 5-10 working days) whilst goods are awaiting dispatch from the Nest warehouse. Please be assured we do our very best to keep delays to a minimum.
            </p>
            <p>
                All large and/or oversized and bulky deliveries to Brazil, Brunei, Chile &amp; Nigeria will be to port only.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, we are unable to deliver all products listed on our website internationally for various reasons such as, but not limited to warranties, logistics and legal reasons. If your order is affected by this, we will contact you directly to discuss the options available to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="txtTitle">Important information about extra fees and tax</b>
                International deliveries do not include customs or clearance fees, duties and taxes, road tax (applicable in Turkey; deliveries to Turkey can avoid this high rate road tax by purchasing additional premium delivery - air - which will then be charged at a lower customs fee) or quarantine and fumigation fees (mainly Australia) which are payable by the customer prior to delivery. Failure to make payment will result in delays (of which Nest cannot be held responsible) and ultimately the return of the goods and further costs accrued.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b class="note">Please note</b>
                From 1 July 2021 all orders travelling outside the UK will be subject to pay VAT at their countries rate upon import. This will be payable along with the import fees and duty due on your order. It is your responsibility as the importer to ensure the correct rate of VAT and duty is paid upon import and we advise you to check the values your countries import rules and regulations with your local customs office.

            <h3>Do you deliver items separately?</h3>
            <div>
                No. If you have ordered multiple items, we will send these out to you in one delivery as soon as they all arrive at the Nest warehouse. We dispatch completed orders unless unforeseen circumstances occur. Please refer to section 8.3 of our <a href="gnbF_usefulLink_terms-and-conditions.html">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.

                We can look to split your order if some goods are needed before others, however additional charges may apply. Please speak to a member of the team for further information by emailing <a href="mailto:info@nest.co.uk">info@nest.co.uk</a> or calling us on 0044 114 243 3000.

            <h3>When can I expect to receive my order?</h3>
            <p>
                If the items you have ordered are in stock, these will be typicllay dispatched from our warehouse within 48 hours. A further 7-10 days may be required for palletising, documentation and collection if your order contains large/delicate/bulky items. If your goods are ‘made to order’, a production lead time as shown on the website will apply; an additional 2 weeks should be added to this for delivery from the brand to our Nest Warehouse.

            <p>
                For UK deliveries, your goods should typically arrive with you within 24 hours if travelling by courier or 2 weeks if travelling via our dedicated delivery partner.
            </p>
            <p>
                For International orders, deliveries of smaller items will typically arrive with you within 4-10 days. For larger, fragile or bulky items, your goods should typically arrive with you within 4-6 weeks if travelling via sea freight or within 2 weeks if travelling via air freight.

            <h3>How much will the duties and taxes be for my international delivery?</h3>
            <p>
                Each country has their own percentage rate. This information can be found at your local customs office. You as the customer are solely responsible for paying these fees.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that from 1 January 2021 all orders travelling outside the UK will be subject to pay VAT at their countries rate upon import. This will be payable along with the duty due on your order. All our international orders are shipped according to the Incoterms® 2020 standards and travel by the Delivered At Place (DAP) term unless pre-agreed with you at the time of order.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is your responsibility as the importer to ensure the correct rate of VAT and duty is paid upon import and we'd advise you to check the values your countries import rules and regulations with your local customs office.
